### Setup

## Enviroment Variables
Before run this project, you will need to create `.env` file in the root directory or set manually the following variables

```
# This it's the api url where you are going to make the request
API_BASE_URL=localhost:3000/graphql 
```


### Development
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
